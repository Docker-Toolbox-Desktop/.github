## About Docker Toolbox

Docker Toolbox For PC is a utility package designed to help users manage and run containerized environments on desktop machines that do not support native Docker Desktop. It bundles essential tools like Docker Engine, Docker Machine, and Docker CLI, relying on virtualization platforms such as Oracle VirtualBox to enable container execution.

This solution is particularly valuable for developers working on older versions of Windows and macOS. With Docker Toolbox, users can configure isolated environments, test microservices, and maintain container workflows without the need for modern hypervisor support. It offers flexibility, command-line control, and compatibility with existing system constraints.
